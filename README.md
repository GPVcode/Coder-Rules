# Coder-Rules

1. Do not repeat yourself (DRY). Write DRY code.
  - Functions can be particularly helpful when it comes to DRY code.
  - Store repeat code into variable to make overall code better looking.

Note: One thing I like about code is that you can make it better and better at your will. You can continue identifying inefficiencies and other ways to make your code cleaner and more maintanable. You can make code look better!
